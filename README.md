Analyzing the death rate of Dogs at Sonoma County Shelter
We examine tens of thousands of data about the animals in Sonoma County Animal Services.
More specifically, we observe what affects adoption, give-up (meaning the owner surrendered a dog or returned an adopted dog),
and death rates for dogs at Sonoma County Animal Services. For adoption and give-up rates, we find the relation between those rates and 
time (months), biological data (sex, size, age, and health), and COVID-19. For death, we find the relation between those rates and biological
data (age and health) on intake, time (duration of stay), adoption rates, and COVID-19.
All of the information above is found on a dataset on the website, data.sonomacounty.ca.gov. 
The data details animals (their identification and biological data) and their situations coming in and out of
Sonoma County Animal Services (their intake/outcome condition, location, and type). 
The County of Sonoma Department of Health Services provides the data for the dataset and the dataset was 
originally created on February 2, 2017, and has been updated daily since.
